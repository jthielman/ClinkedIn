# ClinkedIn
This is an exercise to practice writing an API.  The assignment is [here](https://www.notion.so/nighthawks/ClinkedIn-cb5f5f9fade1480b9ff6cc024bd0f929).  I think the assignment may have been meant to include a front end eventually, but we never did get around to it.

As you may read if you click that link, the concept was a simple social network for inmates in prison, who might want to connect with one another and perhaps charge one another for services rendered.

I was using a borrowed computer for this, so another username is attached to the commits, but don't worry; it was me.  Also, this was a group project, but instead of all contributing to a single repo, we copied and pasted each other's code.  I don't know why. So I no longer remember what I copied from the other group members and what I wrote myself.
